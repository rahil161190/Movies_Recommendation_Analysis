# 📊 Netflix Business Case Study - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## 🔍 Overview This case study analyzes Netflix’s business trends through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), providing valuable insights into content distribution, viewer preferences, and strategic growth areas. By working through this project, data analysts gain hands-on experience with Python-based data visualization and statistical analysis.

## 🚀 Business Context

Netflix dominates the streaming industry with over 200M subscribers globally, offering 8,000+ movies & TV shows (as of mid-2021).

Understanding content trends helps Netflix refine its production strategy and boost engagement.

The dataset comprises 8,807 shows, enabling insights into genre popularity, country-specific trends, and content strategy.

## 📌 Key Business Insights

Content Composition: ~70% of releases are movies, while TV shows make up 30%. However, TV shows are steadily growing YoY, whereas movie releases are slightly declining.

Market Distribution: USA leads in content production, with releases increasing annually.

Genre Preferences: Historically, international films & TV dramas dominated until mid-2021, but documentary releases have decreased YoY.

Diversity in TV Shows: Unlike movies, TV shows span diverse genres, not just one or two.

Regional Content Shift: Recent TV show releases favor regional content, while international TV shows are declining.

Series Length Trends: Most TV shows have 1-2 seasons, suggesting a preference for short-format content.

## 📈 Strategic Recommendations

Expand TV Show Content: TV shows are gaining popularity, yet they only represent 30% of total content—Netflix should increase investments here.

Prioritize Regional Content: To diversify from international series, Netflix should focus on country-specific shows.

Target Key Markets: Growth should prioritize India, Japan, UK, and South Korea, where streaming demand is high.

Optimize Movie Length: The ideal movie duration is 80-120 mins—movies exceeding 300 mins are outliers.

Invest in Comedy & Kids Content: These genres are rising globally and hold strong engagement potential.

Focus on Shorter TV Series: Since short-format TV shows (≤3 seasons) are trending, advertising these strategically can boost engagement.

Increase PG-Rated Content: More PG-rated content will help capture family and kids audiences.

Sync Releases with Global Trends: To stay relevant, Netflix should release movies/shows the same year they premiere globally.

Leverage Strategic Timing: Holiday & long weekend releases can maximize viewership potential.
